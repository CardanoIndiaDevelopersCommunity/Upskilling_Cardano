WELCOME TO CARDANO INDIA DEVELOPERS COMMUNITY

Cardano India Developers Community is a group of highly motivated, self driven, dynamic techno-enthusiasts having combined 45+ years of experience in development, designing and building enterprise application. With keen interest in Cardano Blockchain Devevelopment. They passionate about upskilling developers in Haskell, Plutus, Marlowe, Atala Prism and hence help in building Cardano based Web 3.0 DApps and DAOs.

Projects emerging today can be referred to as the third generation of blockchain technology. Cardano is Blockchain 3.0 network ecosystem that allows users to interact without relying on centralized data repositories but completely decentralized and open source.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are cryptographic assets on a blockchain with unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other. NFTs exist on a blockchain, which is a distributed public ledger that records transactions. 

A decentralized(Dapp), distributed app is an application that is not controlled by a single entity. Otherwise, a DApp is just like any conventional app. A DApp can be a web app, command-line app, desktop app, or mobile.

The difference between a DApp and a conventional app is that the conventional app is controlled by a single entity. A DApp has a blockchain as its backend.
